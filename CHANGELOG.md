and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.3.3] - 2025-09-29

### Critical Bug Fix - API Endpoint Parameter
- **Fixed 400 Bad Request error**: Added required `trip_id` parameter to `/gtfs/stop_times` endpoint call
- **Added fallback mechanism**: Stop pattern functionality is now optional and won't break basic integration
- **Improved error handling**: Integration continues working even if advanced stop features fail
- **API parameter compliance**: Fixed endpoint calls to match Metlink API documentation requirements

This fix resolves the "ConfigEntryNotReady" error and restores basic integration functionality.


## [0.3.2] - 2025-09-29

### Bug Fix - Stop Pattern Implementation
- **Fixed empty stop pattern data**: Resolved issue where `all_stops`, `next_departures`, and `destination_stop` attributes were empty
- **Enhanced route ID matching**: Improved comparison logic to handle both string and integer route IDs from API
- **Added comprehensive logging**: Added debug logging throughout the stop pattern process for better troubleshooting
- **Implemented fallback mechanism**: When real-time predictions are unavailable, integration now falls back to scheduled GTFS departure times
- **Improved error handling**: Better validation of API responses and data structures
- **Enhanced state attributes**: Added more detailed debugging information and scheduled departure times

### New Features
- **Mixed data sources**: Integration now shows both real-time predictions and scheduled times
- **Enhanced debugging**: Added `debug_info` attribute with troubleshooting information
- **Scheduled departure fallback**: Shows GTFS scheduled times when real-time data isn't available
- **Stop sequence validation**: Ensures stops are displayed in correct route order

### Technical Improvements
- **String normalization**: Consistent handling of stop IDs and route IDs as strings
- **Better API error handling**: More resilient to individual stop prediction failures
- **Enhanced logging**: Debug-level logging for API calls and data processing
- **Data structure validation**: Validates API responses before processing

The integration should now properly display:
- Complete list of stops along the route in sequence
- Next scheduled bus arrival times (real-time or scheduled)
- Destination stop information
- Stop-by-stop departure predictions


## [0.3.1] - 2025-09-29

### new feature
- download stop information along the route. This implementation should:
  **Parse stop patterns** for each route/direction using GTFS data
  **Identify destination stops** (last stop in the sequence)
  **Fetch real-time predictions** for all stops on the route
  **Provide rich sensor attributes** including:
    - Complete stop list with sequences
    - Next departures across all stops
    - Destination information
    - Stop prediction counts


## [0.3.0] - 2025-09-29

### Version Bump
- new features to be added from here.


## [0.2.3] - 2025-09-29

### Bug Fix
- no entities created. The AttributeError was preventing the entities from being created properly, which is why they were showing up as devices without entities and couldn't be added to dashboards.
- the key change is"
  **Before:** "last_updated": self.coordinator.last_update_success_time,
  **After:** "last_updated": self.coordinator.last_update_success,


## [0.2.2] - 2025-09-29

### Bug Fix
- no entities created. The problem is in the sensor.py file - the entities need proper device_class, state_class, and unit_of_measurement properties to be recognized as proper sensors.
- The key changes are:
  **Added** native_value property instead of state - This is the modern HA way
  **Added** native_unit_of_measurement = "trips" - Defines what the sensor measures
  **Added** state_class = SensorStateClass.MEASUREMENT - Marks it as a measurement sensor
  **Added** device_info - Groups sensors under a device for better organization
  **Added** available property - Shows if the sensor is available based on coordinator success
  **Added** entity_registry_enabled_default = True - Ensures entities are enabled by default



## [0.2.1] - 2025-09-29

### Bug Fix
- corrected the ***Integration entries*** naming scheme to **title = f"{transportation_name} :: {route_short_name} / {route_long_name}"**



## [0.2.0] - 2025-09-29

### Version Bump
- initial integration is ready for testing



## [0.1.4] - 2025-09-28

### Added
- **Step 4 Complete**: Entity Creation with Direction-Based Naming
- **Dual Entity Creation**: Each route now creates two sensor entities (Direction 0 and Direction 1)
- **GTFS-Based Naming**: Uses authentic GTFS `route_desc` field for Direction 1 descriptions
- **Simplified Entity Names**: Changed from `Transportation Type :: Route / Description` to `Route :: Description`
- **Real-Time Data Integration**: Sensors provide live trip counts and vehicle position data

### Changed
- **Entity Naming Schema**: Now uses `route_short_name :: route_description` format
- **Direction Logic**: Direction 0 uses `route_long_name`, Direction 1 uses `route_desc`
- **Configuration Storage**: Added `CONF_ROUTE_DESC` to store Direction 1 descriptions
- **Sensor Attributes**: Updated to reflect new naming and include direction-specific data

### Technical Details
- Direction 0: `route_short_name :: route_long_name` (e.g., "83 :: Wellington - Eastbourne")  
- Direction 1: `route_short_name :: route_desc` (e.g., "83 :: Eastbourne - Wellington")
- Real-time trip counting per direction
- Enhanced sensor state attributes with direction-specific information
- Improved error handling for missing route descriptions



## [0.1.3] - 2025-09-28

### Added
- **Enhanced Route Selection (Step 3)**: Implemented intelligent alphanumeric sorting for route IDs
- **Smart Route Filtering**: Routes are now filtered to exclude already-configured routes
- **Advanced Sorting Logic**: Handles mixed numeric/text route IDs properly (e.g., "1", "31x", "83", "220", "AX", "CCL")
- **Improved Route Display**: Route options now show "route_short_name :: route_long_name" format
- **Regular Expression Support**: Added regex-based parsing for complex route naming patterns

### Technical Details
- Sort priority: Numeric routes (0), Text routes (1), Empty/invalid routes (2)
- Numeric routes are sorted numerically first, then by any text suffix
- Mixed alphanumeric routes (like "31x", "60e") are sorted by number then letter
- Pure text routes are sorted alphabetically
- Enhanced error handling for edge cases in route data



## [0.1.2] - 2025-09-28

### Changed the logo path to display correctly in HACS
- new image location is https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iamawumpas/Metlink-Explorer/main/custom_components/metlink_explorer/assets/logo%20(256x256).png
- based on the following information:

__ The most common reason for images in a GitHub repository's README.md to appear as broken picture icons within HACS (Home Assistant Community Store) is an incorrect image path, especially when using relative links.

HACS is essentially rendering the GitHub repository's README file. If the markdown for the image link is not a fully qualified URL or an explicitly correct relative path, the image won't load.

Here are the primary causes and corresponding fixes:

1. Incorrect Paths (Most Common)
The way a path works on your local machine can differ from how it's interpreted on GitHub and subsequently rendered by HACS.

Problem: You are using a relative path like ![Screenshot](images/myimage.png). This works perfectly on GitHub's website. However, HACS's renderer may not correctly resolve the relative path from the context it loads the README.

Solution: Use the Full "Raw" GitHub URL
The most reliable method is to use the direct link to the image file, which is served from raw.githubusercontent.com.

In your GitHub repository, navigate to the image file (e.g., images/myimage.png).

Click the "Raw" button.

Copy the URL from your browser's address bar. It will look something like this:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USER/REPO/BRANCH/path/to/image.png

Use this absolute URL in your README.md file:

Markdown

![Alt Text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/USER/REPO/BRANCH/path/to/image.png)
This method guarantees the HACS renderer has a direct, absolute link to the image resource. __



## [0.1.1] - 2025-09-28

### Added - Step 2 Complete: Intelligent Transportation Type Selection
- **âœ… STEP 2 IMPLEMENTED**: Smart transportation type filtering with route availability checking
- Intelligent filtering: Only shows transportation types that have available (unconfigured) routes
- Route count display: Shows how many routes are available for each transportation type

- Enhanced user experience with informative footnote explaining filtering logic

### Smart Route Management
- `_get_available_transportation_types()` - Filters transport types by route availability
- `_get_available_routes_for_type()` - Gets unconfigured routes for each transport type
- Prevents duplicate route configurations across integration entries
- Example: Ferry service with 2 routes will be hidden if both routes are already configured

### Enhanced User Interface
- Updated translations with explanatory footnote about transportation type filtering
- New error messages for cases where no transportation types or routes are available
- Clear indicators showing route counts for each available transportation type
